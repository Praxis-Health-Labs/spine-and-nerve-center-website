Project Scope: Doctor Website Builder Platform
Version: 1.0
Date: August 12, 2025
Prepared By: Gemini

1. Project Overview
This document outlines the scope for a "Doctor Website Builder," a web platform that enables medical professionals (the "clients") to easily create, customize, and launch their own professional websites.

The core concept is to provide a user-friendly, multi-step form within a secure dashboard. Clients will input their practice information, upload media (logos, photos), and select from predefined lists of medical conditions and treatments. This data will be stored in a backend database and used to dynamically populate a library of pre-built, high-quality React components, assembling a complete, public-facing website based on a master template.

2. Key Objectives
Empowerment: To provide doctors with a simple, no-code solution for establishing a professional online presence without needing technical expertise.

Consistency & Quality: To ensure all generated websites are high-performing, aesthetically pleasing, and maintain a consistent level of quality by using a master component library.

Scalability: To build a system capable of generating and serving an unlimited number of unique websites from a single, manageable codebase.

Maintainability: To create a clean separation between the data (client input), the presentation (React components), and the logic (the assembler), making future updates and theme changes efficient.

3. Scope of Work & Deliverables
This project will be executed in three distinct phases:

Phase 1: Frontend Foundation & Component Library
This phase focuses on creating all the visual elements of the final website, using the provided HTML/CSS as a blueprint.

Deliverable 1.1: Project Setup

Initialize a new React (Vite or similar) project.

Integrate and configure Tailwind CSS to match the project's design tokens (colors, fonts, etc.).

Set up a component library directory structure.

Deliverable 1.2: Atomic & Reusable Component Development

Build a library of small, reusable components based on the design.

Includes: Button, SectionTitle, ChecklistItem, StatCard, ServiceCard, DropdownMenu, etc.

Deliverable 1.3: Section Component Development

Compose atomic components into larger, self-contained section components.

Includes: Header, Footer, HeroSection, ExpertSection, ConditionsListSection, TreatmentsListSection, CTASection, etc.

Deliverable 1.4: Static Page Template Assembly

Create static versions of all unique page layouts using the section components and hard-coded mock data.

Includes: HomePageTemplate, AboutPageTemplate, ConditionDetailTemplate, TreatmentDetailTemplate, ContactPageTemplate, etc.

Phase 2: Backend Integration & Client Dashboard
This phase focuses on building the backend infrastructure and the private-facing application for the doctors.

Deliverable 2.1: Backend Setup

Initialize a Firebase project.

Configure Firestore (database), Firebase Authentication, and Firebase Storage.

Define the Firestore data schema based on the data requirements identified in Phase 1.

Deliverable 2.2: Client Dashboard Application

Create a separate, secure React application for the client dashboard.

Implement user registration and login using Firebase Authentication.

Deliverable 2.3: Website Configuration Form

Design and build the multi-step form within the dashboard.

Each step will correspond to a section of the website (e.g., "Hero Section," "Contact Information").

Implement file upload functionality using Firebase Storage for logos and images.

Connect the form to Firestore, allowing clients to save, update, and publish their website content.

Phase 3: Dynamic Assembler & Deployment
This phase connects the frontend and backend, making the websites "live" and dynamic.

Deliverable 3.1: Dynamic Data Integration

Modify the static page templates from Phase 1 to fetch data from Firestore instead of using mock data.

The application will fetch data based on a unique identifier in the URL (e.g., subdomain or user ID).

Deliverable 3.2: Dynamic Routing

Implement React Router to handle all navigation.

Create dynamic routes for pages that are generated from lists, such as /conditions/:conditionId and /treatments/:treatmentId.

Deliverable 3.3: Deployment

Configure and deploy the Client Dashboard application.

Configure and deploy the public-facing "assembler" application.

Ensure production-level optimization and security rules for Firebase.

4. Technology Stack
Frontend: React.js

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS): Google Firebase

Database: Firestore

Authentication: Firebase Authentication

File Storage: Firebase Storage

Routing: React Router

Deployment: Vercel, Netlify, or Firebase Hosting

5. Out of Scope for Version 1.0
The following features will not be included in the initial release but may be considered for future versions:

Multiple website themes or templates.

Client-side custom CSS or layout editing.

E-commerce functionality or payment processing.

Blog or content management system (CMS) beyond the initial form.

Custom domain mapping for clients.

Advanced analytics dashboard.

6. Assumptions
The provided HTML/CSS files represent the final design for the initial website theme.

The content structure (sections, pages) is finalized for Version 1.0.

Clients will be responsible for providing all their own content (text and images).
